## My nixos config

## Running and config

just clone the repo with 

```
https://github.com/insertokername/nixos_config.git
```

and run (**requires sudo for obvious reasons**) 
```
sudo ./first-build.sh
```
first time building the system (so that you automatically generate a default hardware-configuration for you system.)

on subsequent rebuilds use:
```
sudo ./rebuild-switch.sh
```
