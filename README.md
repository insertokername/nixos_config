## My nixos config

i am using this on multiple devices, all of them having different requirements so that's what the `pc-specific.nix` file is.

## Running and config

just clone the repo with 

```
https://github.com/insertokername/nixos_config.git
```

and run (**requires password for obvious reasons**) 
```
./rebuild-switch.sh
```
